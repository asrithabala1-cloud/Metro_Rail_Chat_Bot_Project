Project Overview

Metro rail passengers often face confusion about ticketing, security checks, entry/exit procedures, and platform rules, especially during peak hours. Station staff repeatedly answer the same questions, and printed signboards are not always sufficient.

This project introduces a Generative AI–based Metro Rail Passenger Guidance Bot that provides clear, safe, and informational answers to common passenger queries through a simple web interface.

🎯 Problem Statement

Passengers misunderstand metro procedures and rules

Station staff handle repetitive queries daily

Printed signage is ineffective during rush hours

A digital guidance system is required

The system must not sell tickets or give real-time train schedules

💡 Solution

We developed an AI-powered chatbot using Google Gemini Flash models that:

Explains metro ticket types

Describes security check procedures

Guides passengers through entry and exit gates

Explains platform rules and passenger etiquette

The chatbot is strictly informational and follows safety constraints to avoid operational actions.
